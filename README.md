# üîÅ re.are.na
A web app that enables spaced repetition for Are.na blocks -- serving up three
random blocks from your profile.


### How to install & run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create an application on [Are.na's developer page](https://dev.are.na/oauth/applications). information. When
  you're done, you should have a personal access token on the application's
  page, the link to which should look like this:
  `dev.are.na/oauth/applications/{APPLICATION NUMBER}`.
3. Create the file `re.are.na/flask-backend/pkg/config.py`, as below:
  ```python
  ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your are.na personal access token here'
  ```
4. Run the following instructions:
  - `make venv` to set up a virtual environment.
  - `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
  - `make install` to install the application.
  - `make flask` to run the back-end / Flask server.
  - `make react` (in a separate terminal window) to run the front-end / React
    portions of this application.


### Background
The idea for this app comes from using [Readwise](https://readwise.io) -- a service that allows you to
easily revisit Kindle highlights. Readwise claims to use the [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
technique by resurfacing 3-5 highlights to you via a daily email.

For the sake of context, [I've used Are.na](http://are.na/adi) for close to two years now. I've
created ~100 channels, saved 6000+ blocks, and use it to organize all sorts of
content and resources.

My use cases for Are.na have generally been to:
1) store digital content, and
2) find content I've stored -- particularly when I'm either looking for a
resource I've saved before, or when I'm looking for something in-depth to
read or peruse.

My second use case has a nice side-effect, viz., looking for specific blocks
leads to me stumbling into blocks that I'd forgotten about. Some are
interesting to stumble into because I may force myself to _actually_ spend the
time reading that PDF I'd been putting off. Others are interesting to stumble
into to come back to a block months after adding it to a channel.

Tl;dr -- I figured I could use a Readwise for are.na blocks, which led me to
this.
