# ðŸ¥´ Three (are.na) Blocks A Day
a web app that serves up three random blocks from your are.na profile.<br>
a [readwise](https://readwise.io/) for are.na blocks, if you will.<br>
(three blocks a day keeps the doctor away...?)

### ðŸ›  things to do
- <b>BACKEND</b>
  * store URL on database, use that to send to frontend
  * To send to front end:
    + get data of all three blocks
    + get class of all three blocks, present them accordingly
- <b>FRONTEND</b>
  * refresh should give you three new blocks
  * depending on block class, create type-specific components
- <b>SOME DAY...</b>
  * convert this to have the three blocks be emailed on a daily basis to myself
