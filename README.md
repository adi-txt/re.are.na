# 🔁 re.are.na
A web app that serves up three blocks picked at random from your are.na profile.<br>
A [readwise](https://readwise.io/) for your are.na blocks, basically.<br>

### 🛠 Things to do
  * REFACTOR:
    + setup various dimensions so it doesn't break when you make things smaller
    + unauthorized blocks still not handled (HTTPError / requests...)
    + get rid of test data
    + comment all code
    + pylint + mypy
    + update README.md with instructions
    + tests!
    + testing suite
    + tox
    + longer term...
      - convert this to have this be a daily email as opposed to a web app
