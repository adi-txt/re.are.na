# 🔁 re.are.na
A web app that serves up three random blocks from your are.na profile.<br>
A [readwise](https://readwise.io/) for are.na blocks, if you will.<br>
(three blocks a day keeps the doctor away...?)

### 🛠 things to do
- <b>BACKEND</b>
  * Refactor code
  * Figure out way to do check without creating test data
  * Functionality:
    + add title, add-date, channel name, and image url (for ALL cases) to graphql
    + connect backend to frontend
    + set up refresh button
- <b>FRONTEND</b>
  * refresh should give you three new blocks
  * depending on block class, create type-specific components
  * Text component
    + text
    + visual element (quotes) just because
- <b>SOME DAY...</b>
  * convert this to have the three blocks be emailed on a daily basis to myself
