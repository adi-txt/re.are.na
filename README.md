# ðŸ¥´ Three (are.na) Blocks A Day
a web app that serves up three random blocks from your are.na profile.<br>
a readwise for are.na blocks, if you will.<br>
(three blocks a day keeps the doctor away...?)

### ðŸ›  things to do
- <b>BACKEND</b>
  * set up database
  * store 3 ids in a database such that you do not see the same block twice
  * get data of all three blocks
  * get class of all three blocks, present them accordingly
- <b>FRONTEND</b>
  * refresh should give you three new blocks
  * depending on block class, create type-specific components
- <b>SOME DAY...</b>
  * convert this to have the three blocks be emailed on a daily basis to myself
